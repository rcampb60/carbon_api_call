# Carbon API Call

This script asks you to input your postcode area (the first part of your postcode, i.e. SE1 or G44). The script then calls the Carbon Intensity API to return the latest power generation data and presents these as a percentage.

I've added a requirements.txt to enable you to run this locally.
